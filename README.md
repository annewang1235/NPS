# National_Park_Service_Website

This website allows you to first enter in a state code, which then fetches data for the respective state. It has cool animation backgrounds
and provides a large variety of information, ranging from parks to news from that specific state.

----------------------------------
# Reflection
This is my first time making a website using Flask, so I needed to overcome numerous road bumps along the way. Many things were very new
to me, such as capturing data and keeping it in order to make the necessary API call. This is also my first time implementing an API into
my work - I needed to figure out how the json was being rendered and returned to me in such a way that I can use it effectively. 

Along the way, I learned about HTML preprocessors. I learned how to use pug.js, which allowed me to write files that were much more readable 
and intuitive than pure HTML files (no tags in .pug files). 

I was also able to deploy my website (https://annewang-nps.herokuapp.com/ --> please check it out!) using Heroku. Although deploying a website is a completely new experience for me, Heroku, along with friends who had more experience than myself with deployment, Google, and youtube videos that were specific to using Heroku to deploy Flask applications, made the deployment process fairly simple and intuitive. 

This project brought on a lot of new experiences for me and allowed me to explore the bridge between front-end and back-end development of
a website.

---------------------------------
# New Tools/Skills that I learned/improved how to use:
- Flask
- Pug.js
- how to make API calls through Flask
- HTML/CSS
- HTML preprocessors (pug.js)
- website deployment through Heroku
- Github commands (pushing onto new repository, changing files and recommiting)

---------------------------------
# Future Improvements:
- have the user be able to enter in a park and display information specific to the park
- incorporate CSS templates and more JS libraries
